# mehuled.github.io

This is my personal portfolio website created to showcase my projects, blogs and timeline from time to time.

Watch it live [here](https://mehuled.github.io)!


## Documentation

This has been created using jekyll and {Personal} jekyll theme.

## To run locally

First, you need to install jekyll and the dependencies of { Personal } by running:

```shell
./scripts/install
```

Then, you can build and serve your website by simply running:

```shell
./scripts/serve-production
```

To serve across lan (requires su to forward the port 4000 over lan):

```shell
./scripts/serve-lan-production
```
