title: Simple text editor in JAVA with auto suggest and spell checker
tags: [ 'JAVA', 'Swing' ]
---

In order to better understand data structures and Swing library in JAVA I decide to work on a text editor for myself with features like auto complete and spell checker, 

The project was made and implemented based on the [UC Sandiego MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented).

It was a great learning experience to work on something that I can really use. I use my own text editor and I'm always looking forward to add more features to it like the identification of keywords of programming languages based on the file extension that is .c, .java.

I plan to publish it soon with all those features.
