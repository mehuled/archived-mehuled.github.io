As part of the OOP course in 4th semester we were supposed to work on a project that implemented best OOP practices

So we decided to work on a Instagram like applet that let users post photos and status updates amd which are available on feeds on their friends who follow them.

The inspiration of the project was to understand and implement the use of JSP, JDBC, MySQL and best OOP practices along with understanding the way social networks function by using efiecient data structures to hold user information.

We are presently working on the project and are planning to finish it by 1 April.

Once finshed I'm looking to publish the project using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)(Heroku is a cloud service to manage and build products)
